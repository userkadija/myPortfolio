#  Student Grades Prediction Web App

This is a machine learning web application that predicts students' final grades based on factors like attendance, assignment scores, and test results. It was built using Flask and trained with a Random Forest Regression model.

##  Project Structure

- `app.py`: Main Flask app file
- `models/`: Contains trained ML models
- `static/`: CSS or other static assets (if any)
- `templates/`: HTML templates (e.g., index.html, results.html)
- `Prediction_Dataset.csv`: Raw dataset
- `cleaned_data.csv`: Cleaned version of the dataset used for training

## Features

- Predicts student final grade using input data
- Flask-powered web interface
- Real-time grade prediction
- Machine Learning model: Random Forest Regressor

## Tech Stack

- Python
- Flask
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- HTML/CSS (for frontend)

## How to Run Locally
